# CI/CD Login and Signup — Demo

Simple, static sign up / login demo using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Files
- `index.html` — Home
- `Login.html` — Login form
- `Signup.html` — Signup form
- `style.css` — Styles (responsive, mobile-first)
- `Script.js` — Client-side validation and demo auth (localStorage)

How to use
- Open `index.html` in your browser.
- Sign up (password ≥ 6 chars) and then log in.

Notes
- This is a demo only. Credentials are stored in `localStorage` and are not secure.
